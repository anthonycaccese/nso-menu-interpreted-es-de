           folder and then change the following path to...
           ./theme-customizations/[your filename].[ext]
         - You can also make the avatar dynamic based on the system 
           create an image for each system and set a path like this...

         Carousel Image:
         - This is the top image layer

         - Color sets the default color for the images in the carousel. ffffff means display the original 
           color of the image.  you can also use this to to hide the carousel image by setting it to 00000000
         - Size sets the size that the carousel image will display at

         Game Image:
         - This is the middle image layer
         - Type sets the type of game image to pull in (I would suggest either screenshot or fanart)
         - Color sets the default color for the game image.  ffffff means display the original 
           color of the image.  you can also use this to to hide the game image by setting it to 00000000
         - Saturation sets the amount of color that will display for the game image.
           1 is full color / 0 is grayscale

         <!-- 
         Static Image:
         - This is the bottom image layer
         - Path sets the path to look for static images.  You can do things like add a single image that
           displays for all systems, use a variable to dynamically change the image based on system (using a 
           variable like ${system.theme}) or set a spacer image using the variable ${spacerImage} and tile 
           it using the tile setting below to set solid colors.
         - Color sets the default color for the static image.  you can use variables here like 
           ${systemColor} to display dynamic color based on system.  you can also use this to to hide 
           the static image by setting it to 00000000
         - Tile sets if the static image should be tiled or not.  If you are using ${spacerImage} varaible
           for the path then I would recommend setting this to true.  If you are using a full size image then 
           I would recommend setting this to false.
